# Credit Scoring Analysis

This project explores a **credit scoring dataset** with the goal of understanding factors that contribute to financial distress and building a foundation for predictive modeling.  
The work was completed as part of a university project, focusing on **data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

---

## Project Overview

- **Data Preparation**: Handling missing values, outliers, and transforming features for consistency.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization of distributions, correlations, and key financial indicators.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to better capture financial risk.  
- **Insights & Interpretation**: Highlighting trends that distinguish distressed vs. non-distressed companies.

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit_scoring.git
cd credit_scoring
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook credit_scoring.ipynb
```

Run the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Results & Insights

- Identified key financial ratios that strongly correlate with distress likelihood.  
- Visualized differences between healthy and distressed firms.  
- Built a foundation for future **predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)** to score credit risk.
